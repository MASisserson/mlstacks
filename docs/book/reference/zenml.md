# 🙏 Association with ZenML

[![maintained-by-zenml](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3348134/173032050-ad923313-f2ce-4583-b27a-afcaa8b355e2.png)](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml)

It is not necessary to use the MLOps stacks recipes presented here alongside the
[ZenML](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml) framework. You can simply use the Terraform scripts
directly.

However, ZenML works seamlessly with the infrastructure provisioned through these recipes. The ZenML CLI has an integration with this repository that makes it really simple to pull and deploy these recipes. Detailed steps are available in the READMEs of respective recipes but a simple flow could look like the following:

1. 📃 List the available recipes in the repository.

    ```shell
    zenml stack recipe list
    ```
2. Pull the recipe that you wish to deploy, to your local system.

    ```shell
    zenml stack recipe pull <STACK_RECIPE_NAME>
    ```
3. 🎨 Customize your deployment by editing the default values in the `locals.tf` file.

4. 🔐 Add your secret information like keys and pass into the `values.tfvars.json` file which is not committed and only exists locally.

5. 🚀 Deploy the recipe with this simple command.

    ```
    zenml stack recipe deploy <STACK_RECIPE_NAME>
    ```

    > **Note**
    > If you want to allow ZenML to automatically import the created resources as a ZenML stack, pass the `--import` flag to the command above. By default, the imported stack will have the same name as the stack recipe and you can provide your own with the `--stack-name` option.
    

6. You'll notice that a ZenML stack configuration file gets created after the previous command executes 🤯! This YAML file can be imported as a ZenML stack manually by running the following command.

    ```
    zenml stack import <STACK_NAME> -f <PATH_TO_THE_CREATED_STACK_CONFIG_YAML>
    ```
